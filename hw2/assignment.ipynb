The *qrel* will be supplied by us and should not be changed. For every retrieval model (or combinations thereof) you will generate a run of the top-1000 documents for every query. The format of the *run* file is as follows:\n",

    "   * `$document_identifier` corresponds to the unique identifier of a document (e.g., APXXXXXXX where AP denotes the collection and the Xs correspond to a unique numerical identifier).\n",
    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support. The ranks are computed by TREC Eval itself using the `$query_document_similarity` field (see next). However, it remains good practice to correctly compute this field.\n",
    "   * `$query_document_similarity` is a score indicating the similarity between query and document where a higher score denotes greater similarity.\n",

    "- The main bottleneck of PLM is the computation of the Zi's, but as the author of the paper suggests, a Z_i can be calculated easily using an integration over the entire document space, which gives a form dependent on the cumulative distribution of each kernel function. Below are the final implementations of this integration and it's resultant form for each kernel, furthermore I also show that the sum computed normally is equal to the one computed using this implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For the Gaussian kernel I use the Abramowitz and Stegun approximation of the cumulative normal distribution. This approximation is very good, as there seems to be only extremely minor differences. This does not affect ranking and can be seen after the implementations of the algorithm.\n",

    "In this task you will experiment with applying a distributional semantics methods ([word2vec](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738)  **[5 points]**, [LSI](http://lsa3.colorado.edu/papers/JASIS.lsi.90.pdf) **[5 points]**, [LDA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf) **[5 points]** and [doc2vec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf) **[5 points]**) for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to implement word2vec, LSI, LDA and doc2vec on your own. Instead, you can use [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) (pre-loaded on the VirtualBox). An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a latent semantic model for retrieval, you need to:\n",
    "   * build a representation of the query **q**,\n",
    "   * build a representation of the document **d**,\n",
    "   * calculate the similarity between **q** and **d** (e.g., cosine similarity, KL-divergence).\n",
    "     \n",
    "The exact implementation here depends on the latent semantic model you are using. For example, in the case of word2vec, you only have vectors for individual words and not for documents or phrases. Try one of the following methods for producing these representations:\n",
    "   * Average or sum the word vectors.\n",
    "   * Cluster words in the document using [k-means](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) and use the centroid of the most important cluster. Experiment with different values of K for k-means.\n",
    "   * Using the [bag-of-word-embeddings representation](https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1248). **[10 bonus points]**\n",
    "   \n",
    "Each of these LSMs come with various hyperparameters to tune. Make a choice on the parameters, and explicitly mention the reasons that led you to these decisions. You can use the validation set to optimize hyper parameters you see fit; motivate your decisions. In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will first obtain an initial top-1000 ranking for each query using TF-IDF in **Task 1**, and then re-rank the documents using the LSMs. Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",

Secondly, compute query-document values using the retrieval models above and use them as features. Note that the feature values of different retrieval methods are likely to be distributed differently.\n",
